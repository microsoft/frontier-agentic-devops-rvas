# Ch16 — REST & GraphQL API Automation — Coach Guide

> Audience: facilitators and graders. Pair with the student `README.md`.

## Facilitation notes
- **Goal in one line:** the student drives GitHub entirely from its APIs — REST and GraphQL reads/writes — and ships an **idempotent, rate-limit-aware** reconcile script.
- **Where students get stuck:**
  - **Pagination stops at page 1.** The classic bug: they read 30/100 issues and think they're done. Make them compare their count to the seeded total — if it's short, they're not paginating.
  - **GraphQL node IDs vs REST numbers.** Projects v2 mutations need **node IDs** (`gh api graphql … id`), not issue numbers. This trips everyone the first time.
  - **`-f` vs `-F`.** `-f` sends strings; `-F` sends typed/JSON values (and reads `@file`). GraphQL variables usually want `-F`.
  - **Idempotency.** Their first script double-posts comments / re-adds labels. Push them to "check-then-write."
- **How to unblock without giving the answer:** ask "how do you *know* you've read every issue?" (→ count vs total, `pageInfo.hasNextPage`), and "what would happen if you ran this twice in a row?" (→ idempotency).
- **Org-scoped note:** runs with just an org + org-owner token. `project` scope is needed for Projects v2 GraphQL mutations; `read:org` to resolve the org and board.

## Grading rubric (point-weighted, 100 pts)
| Criterion | Points | What "full marks" looks like |
|---|---:|---|
| REST reads | 15 | Identity confirmed; issues listed and shaped with `--jq` |
| REST writes | 20 | Label created; unlabeled issues triaged; comment posted via API |
| Pagination | 15 | All seeded issues paged (REST `--paginate`); count matches total; `Link` header understood |
| GraphQL queries | 20 | Parameterized query with variables; cursor-paginated to completion |
| GraphQL mutations + Projects v2 | 20 | Issues added to `wth-ch16-board`; `Status` field set via `updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue` |
| Rate limits + idempotency | 10 | `rate_limit` inspected; script backs off; second run = no changes |
| **Total** | **100** | |

## Automated verification hints
```bash
ORG=<org>; REPO=wth-ch16-rest-graphql-automation

# Repo exists and issue volume is there
gh api repos/$ORG/$REPO --jq '{name, open_issues_count}'

# Every issue has at least one label (expect empty output = none unlabeled)
gh api --paginate "repos/$ORG/$REPO/issues?state=all&per_page=100" \
  --jq '.[] | select((.labels | length) == 0) | .number'

# The custom label was created via API
gh api repos/$ORG/$REPO/labels --jq '.[].name' | grep -x 'needs-info'

# GraphQL reachable + board exists with items
gh api graphql -f query='{ viewer { login } }' --jq '.data.viewer.login'
gh api graphql -F org=$ORG -f query='
  query($org:String!){ organization(login:$org){ projectsV2(first:10){ nodes { number title } } } }' \
  --jq '.data.organization.projectsV2.nodes[] | select(.title｜test("wth-ch16"))'

# Rate-limit budget (the script should read this)
gh api rate_limit --jq '.resources.core, .resources.graphql'
```
- The fastest mastery signal is the **"unlabeled issues" query returning empty** plus **board items present** — proves both REST writes and GraphQL mutations ran across the full set.
- Ask the student to run their reconcile script twice and show the second run printing **"0 changes"** — that's the idempotency proof.

## Common pitfalls
- **Single-page reads** mistaken for complete — always reconcile count vs seeded total.
- **Issue number passed where a node ID is required** — Projects v2 mutations fail silently or 422.
- **`-f` used for GraphQL variables** that need types — use `-F` (e.g., `-F first=50`).
- **No back-off** — hammering the API trips the **secondary** rate limit (a `403` with `Retry-After`), which `rate_limit` core counters won't show. Honor `Retry-After`.
- **Token scope** — missing `project` blocks Projects v2 mutations even when REST issue calls work.

## Teardown
```bash
wth teardown ch16 --org <org> --yes
./scripts/teardown.sh ch16 --org <org> --yes   # Bash
./scripts/teardown.ps1 ch16 --org <org> --yes  # PowerShell
```
- Removes only `wth-ch16-*` artifacts (prefix-guarded): the repo (with its issues/labels/comments) **and** the `wth-ch16-board` org project.
- **Manual cleanup (if any):** none beyond the prefixed repo and board.

## Time budget
- Setup + read: ~30 min
- Parts A–B (REST reads + writes): ~45 min
- Part C (pagination): ~30 min
- Parts D–E (GraphQL queries + Projects v2 mutations): ~1.5 hrs
- Part F (rate limits + reconcile script): ~45 min
- **Total facilitated:** ~3–4 hrs across sessions.
